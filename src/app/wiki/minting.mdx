# Minting QORT Coins ðŸ’°

Minting is how new QORT coins are created.

## How Minting Works
- Users **contribute computing power** to support the network.
- In return, they receive **QORT rewards**.

## Requirements for Minting
- **Run a full Qortal node** 24/7.
- **Maintain a consistent connection** to the network.
- **Stake a minimum of 5 QORT**.

## Steps to Start Minting
1. Ensure your node is synced.
2. Register as a **minter**.
3. Start your minting process with:
   ```sh
   qortal mint start
   ```
4. Monitor your minting status with:
   ```sh
   qortal mint status
   ```
5. Keep your node online to continue earning rewards.

## Checking Minting Rewards
To check your minting rewards, run:
```sh
qortal rewards check
```
This will display your accumulated QORT.

## Troubleshooting
### My node is not minting!
- Ensure that your **node is fully synchronized**.
- Check that you have **registered as a minter**.
- Restart the minting process:
   ```sh
   qortal mint restart
   ```

### I am not receiving rewards!
- Confirm that your node has **been online consistently**.
- Check your **minting eligibility** in the Qortal dashboard.
- If problems persist, check the **Qortal forums** for support.
