# Earning QORT and Support the Blockchain by Minting ⚙️

Minting is the process by which Qortal rewards users for running full nodes and contributing to the network's health. It is not mining. There’s no proof-of-work, no competition. Instead, Qortal rewards **consistency, uptime, and contribution**.

## What Is Minting?

When you run a full node on Qortal, you’re helping validate and propagate blocks across the network. Minting is the mechanism that rewards users for doing exactly that (i.e keeping the network alive and decentralized).

## Becoming a Minter

To become a minter, you must now submit a **Minter Card** through the **Q-Mintership** Q-App. This card can contain any information you choose, such as:

- QDN links (websites, blogs, files, videos)
- Proof of contributions
- Activity on the platform

Your application will be reviewed by a decentralized group called **Minter Admins**, and if **40%** or more approve, with at least **10** _YES_ votes you'll be accepted into the **MINTER group**.

⚠️ Important note: You must consider a 30 day period from first transaction before applying to become a minter. For example, adding a name to your account, or purchasing some QORT via Q-Trade will usually give you the first transaction. Furthermore, once you have published your mintership card, you need to check back on your card regularly to **answer questions** Minter Admins may have for you. You must also check back to **accept** the invitation to the mintership group if you are accepted.

> ✅ Sponsorship is no longer required. Minting is now community-governed.

You **must own a name** on Qortal to become a minter. You’ll also need some QORT for creating the name and submitting your card.

## Minting Rewards and Tiers

The more you mint, the more your level increases—up to level 10. Higher levels receive greater shares of the block rewards.

Minting is extremely important to the system, as it is the way that blocks are found, and the chain progresses forward. Without the minters, the chain doesn't move. Due to the extreme importance of the minters, they are rewarded a portion of each block reward.

- **Levels 1 and 2** minting accounts share 6% of the block reward
- **Levels 3 and 4** share 13% of the block reward
- **Levels 5 and 6** share 19% of the block reward
- **Levels 7 and 8** share 26% of the block reward
- **Levels 9 and 10** share 32% of the block reward
- QORA holders transitioning into QORT coin share 1% of the block reward
- Minter and Dev Admins share a minimum of 3% of the block reward, and/or the 'leftover' percentage, which initially will be higher when there aren't users in all of the various level groups, and will decrease over time.

_Note_: There are no more Founder rewards. Founder accounts are no different than any other minting account.

## Block Rewards 

The block rewards on Qortal are meant to be never-ending. Since QORT is a coin on chain, there should always be new QORT available to power the various services on the network.

There is no total cap on the amount of QORT coin that can be in circulation in the ecosystem. Approximately every **6 months** (based on a calculation of 60 seconds per block which is slightly higher), there is a decrease in the block reward from its start at 5 QORT, by 0.25, until 2 QORT is the reward. Thereafter, a vote can be made for an increase or decrease of 0.25 to 1 QORT difference per block via vote, however, this type of vote can only take place one time **per year** (in blocks). For example, if the current block reward was 3 QORT, the vote could only be: 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75 & 4 QORT. (Only up to a 1 QORT difference up or down or any 0.25 increment between.) Block reward can only be voted to as low as 1 QORT per block, or as high as 5 QORT per block. These are the minimum and maximum points in the block reward range which Qortal will ever potentially see. We are currently at 3 QORT per block as of _April 2025_. You can see the current block height on the **Qortal Trifecta** homepage.

## The Role of Minter Admins

- Minter Admins are elected members of the community who can vote to approve or remove minters and fellow admins.
- They receive part of the block reward as compensation.
- Activity requirements will soon ensure only active admins receive rewards.

## How To Start Minting

1. Run your own node (see ["Running a Node"](/wiki/running-a-node) page)
2. Create and publish a name
3. Open the **Q-Mintership** Q-App
4. Submit a **Minter Card**
5. Wait for approval (check back for comments or questions)
6. Once approved, start minting and level up over time!

## Summary

Minting is at the heart of Qortal’s ecosystem. Whether you're running a Raspberry Pi or a full desktop, your consistent presence strengthens the network. By becoming a minter, you not only earn QORT but also play a vital role in the future of decentralized technology. Join us in building a robust and resilient blockchain!
