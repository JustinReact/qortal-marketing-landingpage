# Running a Qortal Node üåê

Running a node is essential for contributing to the Qortal network. Whether you're a minter or simply supporting the network, running a node helps secure the chain and allows you to access Qortal's decentralized features.

## Why Run a Node?

- **Supports the Qortal network.**
- Allows you to **mint QORT.**
- Ensures **data integrity and decentralization.**

### Is Running a Node Obligatory to Use Qortal?

No, running a node is not mandatory to use Qortal. You can access the platform through a public node, on either Qortal Hub, Go, or Extension. We will take a look at how this works in a later subsection of this wiki page. However, be aware that running a node is recommended if you want to contribute to the network, and earn QORT through minting.

## Windows Setup

1. Download the Qortal Core installer from the [official release page](https://github.com/Qortal/qortal/releases/latest/download/qortal.exe).
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. You will see a splash screen indicating that the core is downloading and extracting the bootstrap. It will then run in the taskbar.

4. Once installed, the Qortal Core will start running and connecting to the network. Once it is running, you will see the Qortal icon in the taskbar tray. If it is not fully synced, the icon will be red. When it is fully synced, the icon will turn blue.

## Linux Setup

You can run the Qortal Core on Linux by either downloading the zip file and manually extracting it or using the command line method.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the [Qortal Core zip file](https://github.com/Qortal/qortal/releases/latest/download/qortal.zip).
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Make the scripts executable:
   ```sh
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```
4. Run the core
   ```sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

### Manual Installation

1. Open a terminal window and run the following command:
   ```sh
   wget https://github.com/Qortal/qortal/releases/latest/download/qortal.zip && unzip qortal.zip && cd qortal && chmod +x *.sh && ./start.sh
   ```
   
2. You will see a splash screen indicating that the core is downloading and extracting the bootstrap. It will then run in the taskbar.

    style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "250px" }}
  />

3. Once the core is running, you can validate that your node is fully synced by checking in the Qortal Hub or Extension sidebar.

## Mac Setup

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or higher installed on your machine.
2. Open the terminal. In the Finder, open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal.
3. Run the following command to download the Qortal Core:
   ```sh
    cd && curl -L -O https://github.com/Qortal/qortal/releases/latest/download/qortal.zip && unzip qortal.zip && cd qortal && chmod +x *.sh && ./start.sh
   ```
4. This will start Qortal Core, you will see a splash screen come up telling you it is downloading and extracting the bootstrap for you, let that finish, then it will run with a Q icon on the taskbar (the icon will be RED until it is fully synchronized, then it will be BLUE).

## Bootstrapping Your Node

To synchronize your node faster, you can easily 'bootstrap'. Bootstrapping is when you download a compressed archive of the block database. It will be much faster to get that all at once, than to sync one block at a time from peers.

> **Note:** For ALL operating systems, you can stop the Core, delete the `db` folder, then start the Core and it‚Äôll automatically begin the bootstrap process. Alternatively, you can use the methods below (both achieve the same result). It's best to bootstrap when you're more than 1500 blocks behind the current block height.

### How Bootstrapping Works
When the bootstrap process begins, you‚Äôll see a popup with several 0-100% progress bars. This may take an average of **15 minutes** depending on your internet speed. The bootstrap servers may fail from time to time and will retry the process automatically.

Once the popup goes away, your node is **NOT 100% synced**. It‚Äôll need to finish syncing the remaining blocks, as a new bootstrap is created every **12 hours**. 

### Checking Sync Status
You can verify the synchronization status by:
1. Hovering over the Core icon in the system tray to view the current block height.
2. Opening Qortal Hub or Extension and viewing the current block height in the sidebar.
3. Comparing this number with the actual block height on the chain by visiting [exqlorer.com](https://exqlorer.com/).

### Mac, Linux & Raspberry Pi (QORTector)
1. **Stop the Core:** 

   Open the terminal and run:
   ```sh
   cd qortal && ./stop.sh
   ```
   Wait for the message "ended successfully".

2. Remove the Database Folder & Restart the Core:
    Run the following command in the terminal:
    ```sh
    rm -rf db && ./start.sh
    ``` 
    This will delete the db folder and start the Core, triggering the bootstrap process.

### Windows
1. **Stop the Core:** 
    Right-click on the Qortal icon in the taskbar tray and select 'Exit'.
2. Locate the Qortal App Folder in your file explorer. The path should be:
    ```sh
    C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Qortal
    ```
3. Delete the 'db' folder.
4. Restart the Core by running the Qortal Core application.
