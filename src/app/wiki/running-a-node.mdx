# Running a Qortal Node üåê

Running a node is essential for contributing to the Qortal network. Whether you're a minter or simply supporting the network, running a node helps secure the chain and allows you to access Qortal's decentralized features.

## Why Run a Node?

- **Supports the Qortal network.**
- Allows you to **mint QORT.**
- Ensures **data integrity and decentralization.**

### Is Running a Node Obligatory to Use Qortal?

No, running a node is not mandatory to use Qortal. You can access the platform through a public node, on either Qortal Hub, Go, or Extension. We will take a look at how this works in a later subsection of this wiki page. However, be aware that running a node is recommended if you want to contribute to the network, and earn QORT through minting.

## Windows Setup

1. Download the Qortal Core installer from the [official release page](https://github.com/Qortal/qortal/releases/latest/download/qortal.exe).
2. Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. You will see a splash screen indicating that the core is downloading and extracting the bootstrap. It will then run in the taskbar.

4. Once installed, the Qortal Core will start running and connecting to the network. Once it is fully synced, you will see the Qortal icon in the taskbar tray. If it is not fully synced, the icon will be red. When it is fully synced, the icon will turn blue.
