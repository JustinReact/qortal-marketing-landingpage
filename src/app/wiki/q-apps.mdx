# Qortal Q-Apps üèóÔ∏è

Q-Apps are decentralized applications built on top of the Qortal blockchain. Unlike traditional apps hosted on centralized servers, Q-Apps run entirely within the Qortal infrastructure, meaning:

- **No central server required**
- **Cannot be hacked nor taken down**
- **Truly censorship-proof**
- **Completely open-source**
- **Zero hosting fees**
- **No third-party dependencies**
- **Accessed directly from the Qortal UI**

These apps can be used for anything from blogs and messaging platforms, to marketplaces and development tools!

## Why Q-Apps Are Different

Q-Apps stand apart from Web3 dApps hosted via IPFS or cloud services like AWS. On Qortal:

- Files are stored on the blockchain via QDN (Qortal Data Network)
- There‚Äôs no need for a DNS, SSL certificate, or hosting plan
- Users access the app directly from your **registered name** (e.g., `mydapp` on Qortal)

Everything is peer-to-peer and stored across the network by full nodes.

## How to Use a Q-App

1. Open the Qortal UI.
2. Navigate to the **Apps** tab in the left sidebar.
3. Select any app from your _Apps Dashboard_ and click to launch it.
4. You can search for any Q-App link directly in the search bar at the top <span style={{color: "#0085FF"}}>(blue arrow)</span>.
5. You can visit the Q-Apps Library to find new apps <span  style={{color: "#ee2a10"}}>(red arrow)</span>.
6. You can bookmark apps or search by name by visiting the **Qortal Q-Apps Library**.
7. You can add any Q-App to your Apps Dashboard by clicking on the **Pin** button of any Q-Apps.
8. You can save any Q-Apps Dashboard configuration to QDN to save it for later use by clicking on the floppy disk icon <span style={{color: "#fffb0d"}}>(yellow arrow)</span>.

## Hosting Your Own Q-App

To host your own Q-App on Qortal, you‚Äôll need:

- Have a local **Qortal node** running
- A **registered Qortal name**
- Some QORT to pay for the publishing fees

You can publish a new Q-App by clicking on the **Publish** button in the Q-Apps Library <span style={{color: "#0ea300"}}>(green arrow)</span>. This will open a modal where you can enter the details of your app, including its name, description, category and tags.

## Dev Tools
We are currently working on a **Q-Apps SDK** to make it easier for developers to create and publish their own Q-Apps. This SDK will include:
- A set of libraries and tools for building Q-Apps
- Documentation and tutorials for getting started
- A community of developers to help you with your projects

Stay tuned for more information on the Q-Apps SDK and how to get involved! For now, if you want help with building your own Q-Apps, you can join the **ui-extension** group on Qortal and ask for help there.
