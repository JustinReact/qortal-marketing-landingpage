### Step 2: Secure Your Seed Phrase
1. You will have the option to download a **seed phrase**, which is another option of logging into your account, different than from the JSON file, which is an encrypted version of your private keys. Downloading your seed phrase is completely _optional_, as you can log in using only your **JSON file**, which you will need to save somewhere on your computer after creating your password in the next step.
2. If you do download the seed phrase, **store it safely** in multiple locations, and do not share it with anyone.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Losing your seed phrase and JSON file means you will **lose access** to your Qortal account permanently, so make sure to store it somewhere you will be able to find it later.

### Step 3: Create A Password
1. Set a **Strong Password**, but one that you can remember easily as well. There is no minimum length requirement for the password. Both passwords must match to proceed.
2. When you are ready, click **Create Account**.

### Step 4: Backing Up Your JSON File
1. After creating your password, you will be prompted to **save your JSON file**. This file contains your encrypted private keys and is required to log in to your account.
2. Save the JSON file in a secure location on your computer. You can also save it on a USB drive or external hard drive for extra security.
3. After saving your JSON file, you will automatically be logged into your account and taken to the Qortal homepage.
