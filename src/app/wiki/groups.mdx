# Qortal Groups ðŸ“¢

Qortal Groups is a decentralized feature on the Qortal network that allows users to create and join various groups for communication, collaboration, and more. It operates without relying on central servers, ensuring complete privacy and ownership of content.

## What Are Qortal Groups?

Qortal Groups provide a censorship-resistant way to interact with like-minded individuals. Whether you're building communities, collaborating on projects, or simply socializing, Qortal Groups offer a decentralized space to do it. Groups can be public or private, depending on the creator's preferences. Private groups means people wanting to join must be **admitted** by an admin of the group, ensuring that only selected members can access the content. Furthermore, private groups benefit from **end-to-end encryption**, ensuring that messages are secure and only visible to group members.

## Creating A Group

To create a group on Qortal:

1. Open Qortal Hub and go to the **Chat** tab on the left sidebar. Open the **Groups** section by clicking on the "Group Mgmt" button at the bottom of the drawer that opens.
2. In the **Create Group** tab, fill in the required information:
   - **Group Name:** A unique name for your group.
   - **Description:** A brief description of what the group is about.
   - **Group Type:** Choose between public or private (permission-based) groups.
   - **Advanced (Optional):**
      - **Group Approval Threshold:** This setting determines the **number or percentage of Admins** that must approve a transaction for it to be considered valid. 
      - **Minimum Block Delay:** The minimum amount of time before a transaction can be approved. (e.g., **5 minutes**)
      - **Maximum Block Delay:** The maximum amount of time before a transaction can be approved. (e.g., **15 days**)
4. Click **Create Group** to finalize the group creation.

## Joining A Group
