# Welcome to the Qortal Wiki ðŸ“–

This wiki contains everything you need to know about Qortal, from setting up your node to interacting with decentralized applications called Q-Apps.

## What is Qortal?

Qortal is a **decentralized infrastructure platform** designed to replace the traditional internet with a truly peer-to-peer network. It offers:

- A blockchain-based **governance model**.
- **No central authority**, meaning you are in full control of your data.
- Built-in **decentralized applications called Q-Apps** which offer the chance to interact with the Qortal blockchain directly. There are already many Q-Apps built, such as Q-Tube, Q-Share, Q-Blog, Q-Shop, Q-Mail, and many more!
- The native QORT coin, which powers the Qortal ecosystem, allowing it to turn into a parallel economy propelled by all the Q-Apps using it for all sorts of transactions. The QORT coin also serves as a reward for the minters keeping the integrity of the network.
