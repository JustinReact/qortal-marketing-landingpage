## Contributing to the Wiki 📖

Want to help grow the Qortal knowledge base? Here's how to contribute to the **Wiki**:

- Create a new `.mdx` file inside the `src/app/wiki/` directory.
- If you're **adding a new page**, don't forget to update `src/config/wikiOrder.ts` to include it.

Your `.mdx` file should start with this frontmatter:
```
---
title: "Page Title"
---

## Section 1
Content here...

### Subsection 1
Content here...

## Section 2
Content here...

### Subsection 2
Content here...
```

> 🧠 **Pro Tip:**  
> - The first `##` heading will become the sidebar title.  
> - `###` headings will appear as subsections.  
> - If no `##` heading is found, the page will be placed under **Miscellaneous**.

If you’re updating an **existing page**, just edit its `.mdx` file and add your new content with a new `##` section.
